# Harvey Flood Reports
A simple data viewer for crowdsourced flood reports made during Hurricane Harvey. Use the slider to transition between snapshots of data collected through [U-Flood](https://github.com/nickmcintyre/flood-map). Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Moment](http://momentjs.com/).

## Running locally
If you're comfortable on the command line, navigate to the project folder and run the Python development server.
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or
```
$ python3 -m http.server
```
The map should be accessible from your browser at `localhost:8000`.

Alternatively, the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) text editor makes it easy to preview web apps while you work. After installing Brackets (and Chrome), open up the project folder with Brackets and click on the little lightning bolt. :zap:
